# MontagsMaler - Neural Network Sketch Recognition

This project implements a neural network that can recognize hand-drawn sketches.

## 🖌️ Try Sketching
java -jar MontagsMaler-1.0-FatJar.jar

You can try drawing one of the following objects and see how the neural network performs:

- clock  
- door  
- eyeglasses  
- hat  
- line  
- radio  
- snake  
- star  
- The Eiffel Tower  
- tree

## 🧠 Training the Neural Network

To train the model, run the following Java file:

```bash
javac path/to/nnTraining.java
java Training.nnTraining
